         My name is Jess Smyth.  I founded Skill Share in 2017 after struggling to find work. I had taken time out to raise a family.
      When my daughter started pre-school I stumbled across a temporary job.</div>
      <div class="flex-split">After a full year I finally found a job through a family friend. I wondered how many others were in a similar position, but didn't have someone to make an introduction </div>
