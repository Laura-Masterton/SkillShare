        <p> My name is Jess Smyth.  I founded Skill Share in 2017 after struggling to find work.
          I didn't think twice about stepping away from my career whilst I raised a family. 
          I definitely didn't consider whether it would affect future job prospects.
        </p>

      <p>
        I found a temporary job when my when my daughter started pre-school.
        I didn't find another for over a year.
        I wondered how many others were still stuck? 
      </p>
        </div>
            <div>
              <p>
              I wanted to help - so I Started Skill Share, volunteering my spare time when I could. 
              It is now my full-time job with several support staff. 
              Skill Share is a free service for anyone who has gaps
               in their employment and is struggling to find work. </p>
