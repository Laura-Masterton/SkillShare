# Skill Share Website 

The Skill Share website is a responsive website, allowing users to visit on a range of mobile phone sizes, tables and desktops. The purpose is to find out information about the Skill Share service.

Skill Share is a service aimed at helping individuals who have gaps in their CV re-enter the workforce. The service allows career coaching, CV proofreading and speakers from different sectors. Individuals are paired with a mentor to guide them, and service users meet to 'skill share' . Common examples include a younger individual receiving training in Microsoft Excel from an experienced professional in return for training in social media management. 
Existing and potential users can view upcoming career events. These events are educational and aim to help individuals understand the job market and potentially new career paths.

## Design

### Colour Scheme.
The colour scheme used [Coolors] to generate a colour palette. 
![Coolors-palette](documentation/Skill_Swap_Coolors_palette.png)

### Typography
The website used [Font Joy](https://fontjoy.com/) to pair complimentary fonts to ensure headings were eye-catching and the body text was clear and easy to read. The three fonts are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). The fonts are embedded using an @import url generated on the Google Fonts website.  Each font has a back-up in case the assigned font does not load.
```
font-family: 'Biryani', sans-serif;
font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
```
 Please see (#credits) for further information on individual font designers and licensing. 

### Imagery
Royalty free stock images were used for the hero image and for the photo gallery on the events page. I have credited the authors in the (#credits) section.

## Features

There are five pages in total. The interactive part of the website is comprised of three pages all of which are accessible from the navigation menu:

1.Home
2.Events
3.Contact.

There remaining pages are to acknowledge a user action.

4. Confirmation of subscribing to a newsletter
5. A thank you message when a user sends an enquiry using the contact form. 

* All Pages on the website have:
  * A header section which shows the 'Skill Share' title.
  * A responsive navigation bar. There are links to 'Home', 'Events', and 'Contact' pages.
  The navigation bar grows to fit different screen sizes, maintaining even spacing.  This prevents the screen being cluttered and provides a good user experience. This method is ideal for a navigation menu with only three links, .This  also allows an element of futureproofing, as the navigation bar will still look neat if another menu item is required. It can be adjusted with padding/margin without changing the layout of the page.
  * All pages pertaining to the website will not open a new browser window as per common practice. The user can navigate back to the website easily if referred to the acknowledgement/thank you pages.
* A footer which contains social media links to facebook, instagram and twitter. It also provides another link to the contact page. Social media links will open in a new browser window Font awesome icons were used to promote familiarity as they are instantly recognisable. It presents as uncluttered and tidy whilst still filling the space on larger screens.
