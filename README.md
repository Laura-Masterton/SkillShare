* Poppins: Body
* Cabin: Footer

### Imagery
Royalty free stock images were used for the hero image and for the photo gallery on the events page. I have credited the authors in the (#credits) section.

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop
### Features

The website is comprised of four pages, three of which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, books page & contact us page). The fourth page is a thank you page which is shown once a user submits the form on the contact us page.

* All Pages on the website have:

  * A responsive navigation bar. There is a Home, Services, Events and Contact link. The contact link is a button and is the first call to action which forwards the user to the contact page. The links collapse to the right using a hamburger menu for smaller devices. 
This prevents the screen being cluttered and providing a good user experience. It is also for futureproofing in the case of adding additional menu items. 
* A footer which contains social media icon links to facebook, instagram and twitter. It also provides another link to contact. Font awesome icons were used to promote familiarity as they are instantly recognisable and provide a clean look.
