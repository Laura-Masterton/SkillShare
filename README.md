### Typography
The website uses three fonts from Google Fonts fonts.google.com. The fonts are embedded using an @import url generated on the Google Fonts website.  Each font has a back-up in case the assigned font does not load.
```
font-family: 'Biryani', sans-serif;
font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;
font-family: 'Raleway', sans-serif;
```
 Please see (#credits) for further information on individual font designers and licensing. 

### Imagery
Royalty free stock images were used for the hero image and for the photo gallery on the events page. I have credited the authors in the (#credits) section.

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop
## Features

The website is comprised of four pages, three of which are accessible from the navigation menu (home page, books page & contact us page). The fourth page is a thank you page which is shown once a user submits the form on the contact us page.

* All Pages on the website have:

  * A responsive navigation bar. There is a 'Home', 'Events', and 'Contact' menu link.
  The navigation bar grows to fit different screen sizes, mainting the even spacing.  This prevents the screen being cluttered and provides a good user experience. This method is ideal for a navugation menu with only 3 links, but it also futureproofs the website for one or two additional menu items to allow a pleasing aesthetic. 
* A footer which contains social media icon links to facebook, instagram and twitter. It also provides another link to contact. Font awesome icons were used to promote familiarity as they are instantly recognisable. It presents uncluttered and tidy whilst still filling the space on larger screens.
